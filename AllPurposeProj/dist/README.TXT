LIST OF ISSUES (Also a priority list)
--------------
1. Edit Table temporairily changes column headers but after issuing a new command (Add,Delete,Update)
 column headers are reset to default values.
2. Graph Button opens new window where information can be displayed but hold no real meaning, until issues #1 is 
fixed graphs are at a stand still.
3.Customization of graph for what is displayed on x/y axis, cannot be completed until problem #2 is solved.
3. Formating on the Save file is not uniform at all and needs to be looked at, save function still works just needs to be easier
for users to read.
4. Would like to add a PDF button rather than saving into a .txt save into a PDF form.
5. Overall of editing/adding data needs to be done where key presses can be used rather than clicking on buttons again, basically QOL improvements
where needed. (Ex. User wants to log in rather than click log in, user should have ability to simply hit enter key to attempt a log in)

HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM
************************************************
1. On launch of log in screen base user log in credentials are Username: root Password:root 
(if user wishes to add a log in there are currentley no restrictions may change in future)
2. Database screen will launch next where users can add/delete/update information as they please
3. graph functionality is minimal but can still be used, user MUST select an object from the list then click graph.
